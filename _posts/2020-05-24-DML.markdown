#### Data Manipulation Language(DML)
##### Insert data

```
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3, ...)
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);

INSERT INTO table_name
VALUES (value1, value2, value3, ...);
```

##### Update data

```
UPDATE table_name
SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2, ...
WHERE condition;
```
##### Delete data

```
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```

##### Copy data from one table into a new table

```
SELECT *
INTO newtable [IN externaldb]
FROM oldtable
WHERE condition;
```
Same db

```
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017
FROM Customers;
```
Another db

```
SELECT * INTO CustomersBackup2017 IN 'Backup.mdb'
FROM Customers;
```
##### Copy data from one table into another table
Data types in source and target tables match
The existing records in target table are unaffected

```
INSERT INTO table2
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE condition;
```
